			Review Guidelines
			</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			The best reviews are passionate and personal. They offer a rich narrative, a wealth of detail, and a helpful tip or two for
			other users. Here are some additional thoughts for conscientious reviewers.
			</p>
              <div class="ulistclass">			<ul>

              			Personal experience:
              			</b>
              			We want to hear about your firsthand consumer experience, not what you heard from your co-worker or significant other. Try to
              			tell your own story without resorting to broad generalizations and conclusory allegations.
              			</p>

              			Accuracy:
              			</b>
              			Make sure your review is factually correct. Feel free to air your opinions, but don't exaggerate or misrepresent your experience. We don't take sides when it comes to factual disputes, so we  expect you to stand behind your review.

              			Review updates:
              			</b>
              			Review updates should reflect a new experience or interaction with the business. If you'd like to add new insight to an old
              			experience, just edit your review instead of creating a new update.

			<b>
			User Profile Guidelines
			</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			Don't be shy - use your account profile to let people know who you are and what makes you tick. Users want to read reviews
			from people they know and trust (not those with profiles that are empty or laced with inappropriate content).
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
			<b>
			Talk Guidelines
			</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			Talk is a place for fun, open, and honest conversations about what's going on in your community. And since user trust and
			transparency are important to us, anonymous users who are disruptive to the community will probably be dealt with more
			sternly than those who stand behind their words.
